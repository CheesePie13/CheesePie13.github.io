### Current Features

- 3 holes
- 3 harder version of the holes

For a 1.0 release I would want to add the following features and improvements:
- Full 18 hole course and a hard version of the course
- Regular play mode with scorecard
- Transition animations between holes
- Improved UI visuals
- Improved physics

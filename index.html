<h2>Hey, I'm Matt</h2>

<p>
	Welcome to my blog! I'm a Game Developer based in Toronto, Canada, and this is the place where I occasionally share my thoughts on programming and showcase my personal projects.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for stopping by. <span id="sign-off">Hope you're having a great day!</span>
</p>

<script>
	let signOffs = [
		"Hope you're having a great day!",
		"Hope you're having a splendid day!",
		"Hope you're having a wonderful day!",
		"Hope you're having an awesome day!",
		"Hope you're having a fantastic day!",
		"Hope you're having a super cool day! ðŸ˜Ž"
	];

	document.getElementById("sign-off").innerText = signOffs[Math.floor(Math.random() * signOffs.length)];
</script>

<p>Hey, I'm Matt.</p>

<p>I'm a game developer currently working in the game industry in Toronto, Canada. 
	I've decided to put together this little website to host my blog and eventually 
	show off some of the side projects I'm working on.</p>

<p>I've always had the desire to understand programming concepts more deeply, but 
	the game and programming industries are very fast paced. Too often I find myself 
	learning just enough to get the job done rather than taking time to explore how 
	the code I'm building on really works. That's the type of topic I'm hoping to 
	dive into with my blog posts. I want to break open some black boxes, try out some 
	new programming styles and improve my communicating skills by sharing that 
	knowledge. Hopefully some of it may be of use to you.</p>

<p>Anyways, thanks for stopping by. <span id="sign-off">Hope you're having a great day!</span></p>

<script>
	let signOffs = [
		"Hope you're having a great day!",
		"Hope you're having a splendid day!",
		"Hope you're having a wonderful day!",
		"Hope you're having an awesome day!",
		"Hope you're having a fantastic day!",
		"Hope you're having a super cool day! ðŸ˜Ž"
	];

	document.getElementById("sign-off").innerText = signOffs[Math.floor(Math.random() * signOffs.length)];
</script>

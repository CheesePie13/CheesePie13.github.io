Hey, I'm Matt. 

I'm a game developer currently working in the games industry in Toronto, Canada. I've decided to put together this little website to host my blog and eventually show off some of the side projects I'm working on. 

I've always had the desire to understand things more deeply, but the games and programming industries are very fast paced. Too often I find myself just learning enough to get the job done rather than taking time to explore how the code I'm building on really works. These are the types of things I'm hoping to dive into with my blog posts. I want to break open some black boxes, try out some new programming styles and improve my communicating skills by sharing that knowledge. Hopefully some of it may be of use to you.

Anyways, thanks for stopping by. Hope your having a great day!

# Website
This is my personal website where I host my blog and side projects. You can check it out [here](https://cheesepie13.github.io/).

# Personal Notes
## Post Category Organization
- blog: Programming related posts and project/game progress updates
- games: Game projects, one post per game
- projects: Non-game projects, one post per project
  - Can be game related, just not an actual entire game
  - Not created yet, but should be create once I have projects to show

## General Notes
- Posts shouldn't use h1, use h2 and h3 (h4 not setup yet)
- You'll need to set up css in main.scss if you want to use h4

## Theme Ideas for future
- https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/
- https://jasonlong.github.io/cayman-theme/

## Todos
- Any @todo in the code
- Show tags on posts and search for posts by tag
- Add style for h4 in main.scss
